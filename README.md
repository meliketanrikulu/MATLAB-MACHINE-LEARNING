# MATLAB-MACHINE-LEARNING
Using matlab, different machine learning methods (KNN, K-MEANS, DESICION TREE, LINEAR SVM) were applied with a simple dataset (fisheriris).
Results were visualized using Machine Learning performance criteria (Confusion Matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, presicion, recall, Fscore).
